<p> Hi! I’m Afreen — AI enthusiast, psychology nerd, and lifelong explorer of all things curious and complex.

For over a decade, I’ve worked closely with researchers and professionals across domains like tech, healthcare, and business management, helping bring clarity to complex topics through research, writing, and data analysis. Along the way, I fell in love with the world of Artificial Intelligence — not just the math and models, but the fascinating ways AI intersects with how we think, feel, and behave.

Armed with a Master’s in AI and ML, a solid command of Python, and a strange fondness for statistics, I’m now on a mission to dive into AI research full-time. This blog is my digital playground — where I explore the latest in large language models (LLMs), the intersection of AI and psychology, and why the machines we build might end up being better conversationalists than most humans (no offense, Steve from the last meeting).

When I’m not to neural networks (or about them), you'll find me reading, swimming laps, or exploring open words though video games. 

If you’re curious about AI and want to learn more, you’re in the right place.
